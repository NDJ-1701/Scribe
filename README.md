# :memo: Scribe

Scribe is an accessability-focused application that is meant to help students, especially deaf and hard-of-hearing students, to obtain accurate and clear transcriptions of lecture recordings.

A student or professor can easily upload a locally downloaded `mp4` file, or provide a web link to a video hosted online by YouTube or the user's school.  If video captions are available as a part of the video uploaded, those will be used.  Otherwise, a video transcription will be generated.  A `pdf` will be produced that includes video transcription text interlaced with images of the uploaded video at the appropriate timestamp.  The user can then download, print, or e-mail the resulting `pdf`.

Additional features include language translation to a language of the user's choosing, and user-editing of the resulting transcription to ensure the best accuracy possible in the final transcription pdf.

Scribe also has many other possible uses for thoroughly documenting any type of lecture or presentation.
